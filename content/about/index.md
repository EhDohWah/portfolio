 I'm a senior IT student at AIU (Asia-pacific International University) who loves using my tech skills and knowledge to solve tough problems. I'm eager to help with technology and committed to learning and making a difference in the IT field.

I love coding and love watching coding tips and tutorials video from Youtube!:
